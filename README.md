## A (Rata)TUI interface to manage a single Docker Compose file.

WIP.

TODO:
- [ ] Starting individual containers won't start their dependents' log stream.
- [ ] The ALT modifier key on Mac is not working
- [ ] Auto-scroll logs to the latest entry
- [ ] Display the project name, directory and the compose file name _somewhere_
- [ ] Add an info panel for containers with CPU, memory, volumes, networks, etc.
- [ ] Rework the Keys section because it looks horrible
